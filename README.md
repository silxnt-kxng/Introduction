# Introduction
Just a small intro! No code here!

Welcome! My name is silxnt_kxng, but you can call me Kxng! I'm a 15 year old developer from the U.S. and my main language is Python. I focus mainly on my Discord bots. I mainly use GitHub to keep tabs on my code. Most of my bots can be found on repl.it and they can all be found on my top.gg profile. I really hope you all enjoy what I have to offer. Thank you for reading and happy coding.
